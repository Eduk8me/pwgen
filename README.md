# Eduk8me's Password Generator

With some help from ChatGPT, I've created a password generator. This generator creates passphrases using [EFF's wordlists for random passphrases](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases). The list consists of 7,776 words derived from the original [Diceware list](https://diceware.dmuth.org/) (the site also contains a password generator).

EFF's list removed words that were inappropriate, hard to spell, or could be confusing to remember.

This password generator is only as good as the randomness of Javascript in your browser.
